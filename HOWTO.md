# **Hi there, dear participants of WIT BACKEND MENTORSHIP!**

In this file you'll find all the instructions about usage of homework-repository. 

Let's start from the beginning: there you can find all homework and tests for every of 14 studying weeks in 2 languages - English and Russian.

Every homework or test bind to study week so that's why I've put them in thematic directories with specified name. So you can find all that concerns 1 week in _week 1_ directory. Seems easy? It's easy. :) Also you can find not only homework but test as well - you must finish it before next week call. 

Every homework directory contains 3 files: practice task with its number, theoretical materials important-to-know and admission criteria - what exactly you need to know after reading all the materials and completing practice. 

Some words about homework style:
1. Branch **must** be named according to the template: `feature/TASK-%TASK_NUMBER%`, where `%TASK_NUMBER%` is the task number (ha-ha, classic). As rule its contains two digits divided by a dot: the first one is for week number, the second one - for a specific task.
2. Commit **must** be named according to the template: `[TASK-%TASK_NUMBER]: %Description%`, where `%TASK_NUMBER%` is the task number and `%Description%` is a description (stop laughing) of what you've done in this particular commit. Example: what files were added, what functionality you added, etc. **Sorry, girls, description must be in English.** ;) 
3. Don't push any commit directly in master!
4. Pull-request must be specified with details of added functional.
5. You can merge pull-request in master only after mentor's approve. 
6. Every task from the homework - separate directory. 

Good luck! If you have any questions - feel free to ask your mentor.
